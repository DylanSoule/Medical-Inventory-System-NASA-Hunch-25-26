            Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) often utilize medical supplies without properly logging their usage. This oversight can lead to inaccurate inventory counts, which poses significant risks during long-duration missions where resupply opportunities are limited. NASA requires a user-friendly system that can accurately track medical supplies in real-time and transmit this data back to Earth. Such a system is essential for effective resupply planning and ensuring that astronauts have access to necessary medical resources when needed.
